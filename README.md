NIST-Compliant Web Application
This project represents a comprehensive web application developed as part of a final exam project. It demonstrates secure access control, role segregation, and advanced security measures using industry-standard protocols and guidelines. The project is designed to showcase the potential of controlled access within a professional environment and includes extensive documentation of security controls aligned with NIST guidelines.

Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a web application that illustrates secure access management through various state-of-the-art tools and techniques. By integrating industry-recognized solutions, the project emphasizes the implementation of granular access controls and robust security measures. The final deliverable encompasses a detailed NIST framework that documents all security controls implemented to mitigate potential threats.

Key Features
Access Control & Role Segregation:
Utilizes Keycloak with OpenID Connect alongside LDAP integrated with XACML policies. This combination ensures robust identity management, precise role assignment, and effective permission control.

Encryption Protocols:
Adopts advanced encryption protocols to secure data transmission and storage, ensuring both data integrity and confidentiality.

Secure Credential Management:
Employs Vault for the secure handling of credentials. Sensitive information such as API keys and database passwords is stored and managed following industry best practices.

Compliance with NIST Guidelines:
All security measures and system components are developed in accordance with NIST standards. The project includes a comprehensive framework that details each control implemented to reduce risks from potential security threats.

Tools & Technologies
Keycloak & OpenID Connect:
Provides a powerful identity and access management solution that facilitates secure user authentication and authorization.

LDAP & XACML:
Implements fine-grained access control policies and effective role management within the application.

Encryption Protocols:
Ensures secure communication channels and protects sensitive data using industry-standard cryptographic techniques.

Vault:
Manages credentials and other sensitive data securely, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

NIST Framework Documentation:
An extensive report details how each security control complies with NIST standards, including threat analysis and mitigation strategies.

Conclusion
This project is a demonstration of how modern security tools can be integrated to create a robust and secure web application. By following best practices and aligning with NIST guidelines, the project serves as a benchmark for implementing advanced security measures in real-world environments. It highlights the benefits of controlled access management, encryption, and secure credential handling, ensuring the application meets rigorous security standards.
